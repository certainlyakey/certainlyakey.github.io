I've liked many of the approaches given in the papers we've read. Being sometimes both qualitative and quantative, they also mostly allow for different interpretations (except maybe for the card sorting method), not restricting and being explorative in nature. However, the papers we've had give out specific algorythms for conducting the evaluation, and that is a good thing, because without it there's a high risk of being left without any solid data that could be employed for further development. 

What's interesting, most of these methods concentrate on externalization of human experience with design products, presuming that people cannot express their thoughts or feelings directly (even the contextual laddering based primarily on discussion follows this convention). For example, photo elicitation method tries to exert unstructured feelings and thoughts of users based on images shown to them, mapping methods make people externalize their "schemas" and connections between things etc. In a way, a continuation of card sorting, multiple sorting method, allows to highlight the inner constructs of various nature, maintaining the rigor and at the same time open mindedness and giving to designers a possibility to "see the world in eyes of users". That's the method that I'd probably choose for our early prototype when it's ready.
