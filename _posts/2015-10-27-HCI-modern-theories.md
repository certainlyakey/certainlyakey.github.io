This time I tried to follow the (relatively) simple methodology that has established last time during M4 individual homework. As this part of the book was sometimes historical in its detailed review of 'who-introduced-what-theory' and there were many examples, I decided to go with mostly hierarchical and often mindmap-like structure. To make things clearer I also color-coded some of the repeating aspects of each theory/approach reviewed by Rogers, like its type (orange), its pitfalls (bright red), its main focus (dark red), ancestor literature or theory (green), which theories or frameworks tried to follow in its footsteps (black).
