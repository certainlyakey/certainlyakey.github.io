This concept map came out easily, as my comprehension of the material given in the book of Rogers was quite strong. 

I liked the reasoning behind Green's cognitive dimensions and resource model of Wright and even thought I would likely use both in my own work. I especially appreciate how Green tried to make HCI theory closer to  designers and even users, avoiding unnecessary and complicated science language.

As to distributed cognition approach, it's quite elaborated and at the same time seems simple. I'm eager to try it sometimes in a real project.
