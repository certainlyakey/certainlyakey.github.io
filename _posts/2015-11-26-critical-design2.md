#Critical design brief 2

The main goal of the CatRescue organization is to find new permanent homes for cats who have become homeless.

Knowing the cat’s character and needs, we try to find a new home and a family that is most befilling. 

There are a lot of reasons for abandoned cats, you can find a detailed scientists report here [http://certainlyakey.github.io/critical-design/](http://certainlyakey.github.io/critical-design/).

We think the key problem is that cats are treated as a things, but they should be treated much more in a human manner. We address the very core problem.

##Our target issues

- cats loose home due to their values/characteristics does not match the host values and characters

- cats loose home due to their visual changes as grownups

- cats runaway form home because of internal feeling and drive they can have a different, better, more meaningful life

- cat’s don’t meet expectations by cat family members and their relationships fall apart

- cats have rights to full, qualitative life, equal to human life. They have rights to their values, freedom, personal development.

##Target audiences

- cats that are looking for new goal of their lives and new family
- humans — cat’s family members & hosts, willing to have a cat in their family. (those that didn’t get along the cat before are also welcome)

##Critical artifacts

To find the best home possible, we do an **extensive research of each cat personality** — cat therapist is involved, a coach to identify the cat’s life goal, also a cat astrologist identifies the best location and new host finding. In that way we are able to come up with best family for cat need and future positive development.

If needed, we can offer a similar service for cat ex-hosts, in order  to recover from previous cat’s loss and learn from mistakes, to avoid them in next cat project.

There are 50 to 60 cats living in our care homes right now, going through the **coaching and mentorship program**.

It takes a while, therefore we need to provide a proper experience for them right now, and provide a proper ground for their future, stunning lives. 

Cat’s are provided with a warm **house with marble floors, a playroom and a golden hall for annual spring welcoming concert.** 

It’s one of the meaningful ways of using taxpayers money, to provide a recovery from their emotional crises and avoid their negative personal development.

The cats are **vaccinated, castrated or sterilized** and the ones that are ill are treated properly before going to a new home.

We do that in order to **make sure cats have full attention to their personal growth**, their core value finding process, and their lifetime goal — finding a new, perfect family and host. Illness as well as getting a cat-family could reduce cat’s focus from mentorship program and psychological health, which is not in favor to them. Cat main life goal is to find a perfect human family and spend as a replacer of a human babies for the rest of their lives.
