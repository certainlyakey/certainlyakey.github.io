#Targeted issues

- There are many abandoned cats:
	- people tend to abandon cats when they grow up (not so cute anymore?);
	- people aren’t responsible for their cats;
	- people don’t care about the character of the cat;
- cats get lost;
- violence against animals, bad conditions for cats (cats are taken away from the owner);
- people are not aware that the animals are taken care of and treated (castrated or sterilized and vaccinated) in the shelters and care homes. That creates distrust and prejudices against shelters;
- shelters don’t have enough money to keep the cats forever and need constant donation. And in the example of _Kassiabi_ it’s not emphasized how to help;
- people don’t know how to prepare for a new animal - what “equipment” to buy, e.g. cat litter, food etc. They therefore either think a cat acquirement will require too many preparations or on the contrary consider this not important;
- people aren’t aware of what responsibilities come with a cat;
- **people don’t know which cat to choose - how their personality connects with their own personality (that the cat would be taken to the right home);**
- people can’t engage with the shelter cats on a personal level easily.

#Targeted audience

- people who want to help (volunteers and “investors”);
- people who want to get a cat.

#Critical artefacts

Based on chosen issue (emphasized by bold), we thought of several possibilities here.

- “Cat tinder”: an online system is provided that determines the psychological portrait of a person and his lifestyle and provides an appropriate selection of cats that fit well to this person (with a rewards system where you unlock the next stage by moving further);
- the potential owner can view any cat via web camera and get emotionally close to a a certain cat while at the same time making a decision on which cat to take;
- for more engagement cameras (GoPros, for example) could be installed on cats and it allows to view a cat life through its own eyes;
- any person visiting the shelter could leave feedback about encounters with specific cat, and people who decide to take a cat will get all the feedback about them (both positive and negative);
- guidelines on how to interact with cats could be provided on location;
- interactive illustrated stories about cats could be created by volunteering designers for further emotional attachment;
- 3D cat (with trial!);
- system of giving cats nicknames based on their looks and behavior could be provided on the site for the community. The names that won most votes could be offered to new owners.
