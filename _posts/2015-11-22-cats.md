#Targeted issues

- There are many abandoned cats
	- People tend to abandon cats when they grow up (not so cute anymore? :D)
	- People aren’t responsible for their cats
	- People don’t care about the character of the cat
- Cats get lost
- Violence against animals, bad conditions for the cats (cats are taken away from the owner)
- People are not aware that the animals are taken care of and treated (castrated or sterilized and vaccinated) in the shelters and care homes. 
- Shelters don’t have enough money to keep the cats forever and need constant donation. It’s not emphasized how to help.
- People don’t know how to prepare for a new animal - what to “equipment” to buy, e.g. cat litter, food etc.
- People aren’t aware of what responsibilities come with a cat.
- **People don’t know which cat to choose - how their personality connects with their own personality (that the cat would be taken to the right home).**
- People can’t engage with the shelter cats in a personal level easily.

#Targeted audience

- People who want to help (volunteers and “investors”)
- People who want to get a cat

#Critical artefacts

- “Cat tinder”: an online system is provided that determines the psychological portrait of a person and his lifestyle and provides an appropriate selection of cats that fit well to this person (with a rewards system where you unlock the next stage by moving further)
- The potential owner can view any cat via web camera and make a decision on what cat to take based on 
- Cameras (GoPros, for example) are installed on cats and it allows to view a cat life through it’s own eyes
- Any person can leave feedback about cats and people who decide to take a specific cat get all the feedback about them ever left 
- Guidelines on how to interact with cats should be provided on the place
- Interactive illustrated story of the cat
- 3D cat (with trial!)
- System of giving cats nicknames based on their looks and behavior
