##What HCI is all about

Human Computer Interaction is a multidisciplinary field that joins two big seemingly having few join points domains of research â€” human psychology and behavioral studies and computer science. It also draws certain strength from design area which is what connects HCI to humanities.

The HCI area was anticipated by the advent of library technologies. The need for more advanced methods of finding and manipulating information is still there, but now HCI field is much wider than that, including all kind of relationships that may exist between a man and a computer. This area is all about studying humans: it needs to know people better, and that need cannot be generalized, each audience needs its own approach again and again. (I like this part specifically - this is what makes HCI an area that just cannot stop developing further.) The HCI area is all about creating a sense of dialogue as well: interaction should not, of course, pursue the same goals as a Turing test, but a user should carry on a dialogue with a computer interface on equal terms without any concerns about safety, honesty or other emotional or rational disbalance. The HCI area is all about design: it requires a lot of research and trials to build a product working and pleasant to use for all people.
