###Animation in Interfaces of Content-oriented Websites 

####Description

This paper is devoted to the use of animation in mass media sites interfaces. The idea came to me after visiting the Future of Web Design conference in London (april 2014). The paper is mainly practically oriented: it suggests the functions animation could have in an interface based on previous research related to the subject, tries to isolate the factors that form an animation and describes how the mass media on the web apply various techniques involving it. The examples for this paper are unusual because they are mostly animated, the solution was to use animated GIF format for them. 

The paper has won an award for the best publication in the 2014-2015 academic season on the MSU Faculty of journalism.
