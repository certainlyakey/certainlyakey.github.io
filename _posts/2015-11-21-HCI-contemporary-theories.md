In this assignment I tried to organize contemporary theories in two directions, which are, with a degree of approximation, "more socially conscious" and "more reflexive" theories. This, together with the Rogers' division of theories into "turns", helped to consolidate the disorderly world of contemporary HCI. I noted many interrelations between theories, their influences, and more generally, turns themselves. Also thanks to the map it's visible that amount of well formulated theories is less within the body of culture & design turns than what embodiment and wild theories provide. However, this may be an aberration due to the structure of the book.
