The 6 data eliciting methods that are covered in 3 papers given are: repertoire grid technique (RGT), triadic sorting, free sorting, direct elicitation, ranking and attribute list. The first one has a solid psychological foundation - it operates such concepts as personal constructs. Its role as an evaluational tool and its idiosyncratic focus may be useful for our research - for example, we could use it to explore the feelings of our would be users regarding different features or design solutions in our product. We're interested in improving interest and satisfaction of our users, that's why RGT could be of special use to us.

The repertoire grid technique is based on triad sorting method, that evidently can be used by its own though it's normally used with products and not design elements of one product. This method is good for preliminary study or for checking up in the middle of design process of existing prototype with other market solutions. Free sorting is the good ol' card sorting method with attributes and categories being grouped by users themselves. It's especially good for cognitive modelling, but for our project it may be not what we want due to the lack of large amounts of categorizable information.

Direct elicitation also may be a wrong choice, because it requires to compare different products proactively, and our users may not be that interested in trying out different products of this kind - this is a low involvement product. Same with the ranking method, being also the slowest method, according to Bech-Larsen/Nielsen paper. The last one, attribute list, may be utilized in our research even though it generates the lowest number of attributes. On the positive side, the information that we'll finally get will be highly structured and well-formed. However, in this case possibly there's a need to gather a focus group to generate the attribute list from which to pick, and for that we may not have enough resources.
