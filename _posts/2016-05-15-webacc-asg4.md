I chose two pages from RZD website to test and correct:

- Timetable page ([page itself](http://pass.rzd.ru/tablo/public/ru?STRUCTURE_ID=704&layer_id=5379&src_code=2000000&dst_code=2004000&ti=&src=%D0%9C%D0%9E%D0%A1%D0%9A%D0%92%D0%90&date_dep=14.05.2016&dst=%D0%A1%D0%90%D0%9D%D0%9A%D0%A2-%D0%9F%D0%95%D0%A2%D0%95%D0%A0%D0%91%D0%A3%D0%A0%D0%93&date_arr=14.05.2016&train=), [my markup](https://jsbin.com/xizizo/edit?html,output));
- Vacancies & Social page ([page itself](http://social.rzd.ru), [my markup](https://jsbin.com/sexajo/edit?html,output)).

After testing the unmodified pages with VoiceOver I found that:

- a link to the english version of the site that contained `eng.rzd.ru` as its text was read letter by letter, which could be remedied for example by a more accurate description in a hidden, special for screen readers box;
- menus are not marked up as navigation which means elements of all three navigations read in a mixed way;
- field placeholders and values are marked up incorrectly and read without indicating that they're part of a field;
- popout elements do not get read off automatically;
- disabled button isn't understood as such by screen reader;
- etc.

I could share several findings as the result of testing of the changed markup with VoiceOver:

- I used semantic HTML5 tags, but it seems that they're incompatible with ARIA in terms of markup validity - if, say, `header` tag is used along with `role="navigation"` attribute the W3C validator will issue a warning about an unnecessary attribute present;
- I decided to organize tab navigation so that: 
	1. the hidden navigation links (`Go to header` and `Go to main content`) would come first â€” this would allow users to decide right away which section of site they want to visit,
	2. form in the main content would come second - that would allow to use the main functionality of this specific page without unnecessary tabbing,
	3. global site search would come third, 
	4. and only after that tabbing would start to follow normal DOM order;
- if a `role` attribute is present it doesn't matter for the screen reader which tag will be used - semantic or neutral;
- an `aria-label` attribute of a navigation parent tag (`nav` or `div`) doesn't get read when links in navigation are read separately (for example when they're being browsed via tabbing and not full-scale reading of the page). This could be a bit inconvenient;
- the presence of form in a continuous reading is not highlighted at all unless `aria-label` is used;
- in a fieldset with every input the legend of the fieldset is read which is quite good. This means that it may be needed to use fieldsets for every group of form elements even small ones like search input + search submit;
- if an `aria-label` is present it will be read as a part `currently at ...` message;
- in an `aria-label` attribute value it might be good avoid using the same words that are already present in `role` attribute or tag name;
- `aria-describedby` attribute contents only gets read when the focus stops at the current element. It won't be read if there's an ongoing reading that goes continuously from one element to another;
- `aria-describedby` can't be used with `form` tag.
