I chose to analyze the research on bereavement by Odom et al. It uses thematic analysis as the main field study method. The paper mentions that there were 11 participants and interviews were semi-structured. In the interviews questions were asked to elicit retrospective reflections and to provide self reflections on participants' legacies. Part of interview was held during a "home tour" that was supposed to show how people interact with artifacts associated with lost friends/relatives. The authors note that audio recordings are 18 hours long.

The order in which thematic analysis was done in this research is a bit strange. Instead of looking for codes in all the recordings and organize them into themes after all the codes were collected, researchers chose to find themes without coding first in "relevant segments". This poses an important question of how it was decided whether a certain segment of interview was relevant. The approach that the researchers took is a theoretical, or top-down one. This means that the data was looked through with a specific interest in mind. They also wanted to provide a detailed account of particular groups of themes, that is, themes related to bereavement. The description of the procedure of how thematic analysis was done is not reflected fully enough in the paper, though, so it's not possible to verify if the process was correct.

The analysis itself is done in a latent manner, with underlying ideas and conceptualizations, with many questions or problems assumed or offered for further investigation. Some socially grounded takeaways are also provided which may bring the research closer to the constructionist perspective.

The paper presents several findings that are based on themes found in the interviews. For almost each finding, several, representative enough, examples are given. This supports the guideline for conducting thematic analysis that's offered by the Braun and Clarke paper â€” there should be enough supporting material for each theme and it should support strongly as an evidence for a theme. 

In the end of the paper, a sum up is done that merges findings into several common overarching themes (such as "Clarifying exchanges through contextualizing content" or "Marking shifting status and state"). These themes allow authors to provide a more practical view of how the expressed feelings and opinions of the people could inform specific design ideas.
