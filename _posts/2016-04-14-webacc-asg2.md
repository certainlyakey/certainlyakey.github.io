I chose three pages from RZD website to test and correct:

- [Contacts page](http://contacts.rzd.ru/) ([edited code](http://pastebin.com/Zt7tgLa1));
- My orders page ([initial code](http://pastebin.com/i1hANp55), [edited code](http://pastebin.com/45SJkKRN));
- [News page](http://pass.rzd.ru/news/public/ru?STRUCTURE_ID=657) ([edited code](http://pastebin.com/VmL7Zegj)).

These were tested before editing in Achecker web service and WAVE installed in a Google Chrome browser. Markup was edited in Sublime Text editor and then checked again in both tools. Only errors with "red" (WAVE) or "Known problems" (AChecker) status were corrected.

Each page had from 10 to 25 errors detected. Many errors were appearing repeatedly, but some 30%-40% were unique to each page.

These are, sorted approximately by the frequency of appearance:

- absence of `alt` or blank `alt`. Solution: appropriate text was added;
- no language defined for document. Solution: add attribute `lang="ru"`;
- no labels referring to some form inputs. Solution: added labels with `for` attribute and an appropriate text. `input type="image"` was detected by AChecker as a "label missed" element, but `alt` was present so this alarm may be considered false;
- `b` or `i` non semantic tags used. Solution: replaced with `em` and `strong` where needed;
- blank heading â€” add appropriate text to heading
- and some others.
