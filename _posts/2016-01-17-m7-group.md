The team members for this final group assignment of the Foundations of HCI course were:

- Aleksandr Beliaev
- Elina Kapanen
- Liina Kukk
- Liga Letina
- Maciej Szlosarczyk

We decided to create a structured representation of all the theories that we’ve studied in the course first so we would have enough data to analyze.Then, based on this data, we’d visualize it to show how the HCI theories we studied through the semester were applied in design practice.
 The outline of our work was the following: 

- we divided the theories according by Yvonne Rogers' three periods (Classical, Modern and Contemporary); 
- we analyzed them to make an easy logical connection between what theoretical basis they used (keywords/concepts) and what practical applications they have or could have. When we couldn't provide a real project or product, we named a category. The keywords or description for a theory were chosen by each member of the team on the simple criteria of their logical appropriateness and a theory's original take on the problems of HCI field. The outcome of this stage is a table as a presentation for easy reading which [can be seen here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JLQBF59VwCzaBiHkx19_MZt4LUX74vQsFfA0SvlNAhk/edit?usp=sharing);
- we visualized this connection as an infographic based on periods and years of each theory's activity.

Our work has resulted in an easy-to-digest timeline where we have tried to sum up the process of metamorphosis HCI theories had from Classical to Contemporary eras in general.
