title: How I've Read 100 Papers and Ended Up Knowing Something New
excerpt: M1 individual assignment
course: Foundations of HCI

I got the most important concepts by extracting really important for me in the paper keywords. The concept is a keyword, it's just kind of personalized keyword or a paper subject aspect that's interesting to me. 

I spent 2 full days, 1 day selecting the papers from the whole universe of 4 conferences and another skimming through remaining 100. The most difficult part was to get the most useful information out of each in the chosen 100 papers. For that I tried to concentrate on abstracts, discussion, results and conclusion parts.

I especially liked these two papers:

1.  Diana Nowacka, Karim Ladha, Nils Y. Hammerla, Daniel Jackson, Cassim Ladha, Enrico Rukzio, and Patrick Olivier. 2013. Touchbugs: actuated tangibles on multi-touch tables. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '13). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 759-762. DOI=10.1145/2470654.2470761 http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2470654.2470761
2.  Shaun K. Kane, Brian Frey, and Jacob O. Wobbrock. 2013. Access lens: a gesture-based screen reader for real-world documents. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '13). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 347-350. DOI=10.1145/2470654.2470704 http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2470654.2470704
