I liked this paper because it explains on practical example what a transformational object is and tells many things about the people being involved in using such artifacts. The paper is an easy read and sometimes even its tone is playful (which stands in harmony with its subject). The problem it deals with is somewhere in between turn to culture and turn to embodiment, with its solution having both interpretative and phenomenological attributes. It's cool to see how the irony and forcible creating of some friction allow to encourage people for real action.
