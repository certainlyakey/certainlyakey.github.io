excerpt: Reading the final chapter of Yvonne Rogers' book
course: Foundations of HCI

The strongest points made in this final chapter, as I think, are:

- the conceptual frameworks created by theoretical research often are gain popularity in HCI because they often are applicable and convertable to the design practice, guiding it by creating a mapping between chaotic design experiences and some structured labels (from). This single fact allows for more order in brains of design practitioners and teases them by its geometrical harmony. Rogers shows that some, maybe more flexible frameworks such as cognitive dimensions lose this battle because they do not prove immediately their value to designers requiring thorough study and time which designers predominantly do not have. A dispute between the high level of rational intelligibility, from one side, and scientific reliability (that is, the idea or framework is capable to explain as many things as possible), from another, may be traced here;
- at the same time, these theoretical slenderness and striving for architectural neatness lead to conflicts between different frameworks and people behind them, and to overcome this the HCI community should embrace more tolerant and inclusive approaches. This is naturally possible again on the basis of design practice, where those methods are good which work well in real life. So possibly HCI (to also close the existing gap between theory and practice, as said by Rogers) should depart from more theoretical reasoning and propose theories that can be immediately verified by practice.
