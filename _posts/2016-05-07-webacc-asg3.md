I conducted testing of WebAIM test pages with VoiceOver (OS X Yosemite). During testing I noticed several usability issues or just interesting features, most of them while testing the page with forms:

1. Test page with images — this page took about 5 minutes to test being the easiest one:
	- blank `alt` attribute resulted to have worse experience for a user than no `alt` at all because VoiceOver didin't even mark it as an image.
2. Test page with tables — this page took at most 10 minutes to test:
	- when header cells are present VoiceOver unfortunately doesn't read their labels automatically when browsing ordinary cells (however it does this when arbitrary command, <kbd>VO+c</kbd>, is issued).
3. Test page with forms — this page took most of the time, about 30 minutes to test with repeated readings for some examples:
	- in a correctly marked up form, for an unknown reason VoiceOver lists only 2 checkboxes when introducing a checkbox group instead of 3 actually present;
	- when reading out a chosen option in a dropdown menu VoiceOver reads out chosen option value first and only then the label. This sounds unnatural, especially if the label of a dropdown menu is formulated in question form (`4`, `How many kids do you have?...`);
	- when there's no label the system doesn't introduce a group of checkboxes  but it does with radio buttons group, however, this happens only if a group of radio buttons have the same `name` attribute;
	- while reading out ordered lists VoiceOver doesn't make a pause between number and text;
	- placing label and input in cells that are not adjacent to each other (for example, they're supposed to be read vertically and are placed in the same column but different rows) produces totally bad result for a screenreader because label and input will not be read consecutively;
	- if a form element is located in a spanned cell - it will be read out several times depending on how many cells it spans.

As a result, a developer should:

- always test a markup with real users;
- follow the guidelines for building tables such as using at least header cells;
- follow the guidelines for building forms and avoid using non standard elements and putting form elements inside tables because it creates unnecessary noise when utilizing screenreader to read out such a page;
- know the most common ways people use screenreaders and their features and shortcuts. Possibly it's useful to see which commands are most popular and which are not used for the most of the time. For example, <kbd>VO+c</kbd> command reads out the header cell value at any time, which is convenient because it allows to orientate and navigate a big table more easily. But users may not necessarily know about it, therefore developer might consider breaking up a table into smaller tables to ease up cognitive load;
- be aware that screenreaders do not propose the best solutions for continuous reading and users will be forced to relisten some of the portions of the page;
- be aware that screenreaders not always give the best experience ever and some additional mechanisms should be thought out if possible to enhance it specifically for users who utilize them.
