This paper is much more interpretative that the first one. It tries to study how the seemingly rigorous design constructions that are usually built on an assumption of being generally acceptable can be interpreted freely so that a number of different design strategies is possible. Thus it celebrates the human ability to add one's own value to everything. I especially like the design strategy 2, where in a completely philological tradition a poliphonic dialogue unfolds between the behind-the-scenes virtual "metadata characters" that are added to videos.
