#Sample 6 â€” a content-oriented website design and development

##A website for Moscow Lexical Typological group (March 2015, link: [http://lextyp.org](http://lextyp.org))

###Description

This website was designed and developed for Moscow-based research group MLexT (Moscow Lexical Typological group), that represents a part of Higher School of Economics. The website is primarily content-oriented but contains some advanced functionality such as publications filtering and search system. It is built with Wordpress CMS using my favorite frontend toolkit such as SASS and jQuery. Additionally, a lot of effort has been put into adaptation of CMS interface for the specific tasks of MLexT administrators. There's an english version of the site, but not much content has been added to it compared to the russian version.
