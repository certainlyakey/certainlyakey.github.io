title: Evaluating design concepts
excerpt: Individual assignment 1
course: Evaluating the User Experience

From the three approaches given in the three papers I've read it's easy to compare the first and the last, which are Anticipated experience evaluation (AXE) and Sentence completion. The authors of the paper where the last one is covered call it a technique, while AXE is exposed as a method, but no matter what they still solve the same problem. It's about how to get qualitative data relatively fast and in a structured form while not sacrificing the rich amount of experiential information that this data may give. 

For example, AXE method offers a full fledged framework for analysing how users would perceive a product and what they expect from a design concept proposed to them. It is tied to specific stages of product development - evaluating concepts and ideas which may be established theoretically but may not yet be fleshed. It's also interesting how it battles the semantic bias that always emerges when a researcher tries to communicate with a user. Personally I think that it's a method I'd choose to go with when evaluating the ideas of our integrated project, Advanced Jukebox. There're two reasons for that: this method seems mature, efficient and it has strict structure, and at the same it gives enough qualitative data to work with. 

The third method described in the book of Goodman, Kuniavsky and Moed, is no less interesting, but it has another focus: it tries to employ the experience of competitors having a user look on their products. Seeemingly being more commercially inclined than other methods here, it nevertheless gives much food for thought in terms of user experience, comparing the audience, highlighting the weaknesses and advantages of the competitors and as such allowing to reflect more independently on the development of your own product.
