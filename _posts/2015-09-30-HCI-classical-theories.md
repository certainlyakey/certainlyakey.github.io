My map was based on the idea (explained in the book by I. Rogers) that all of the classical theories of HCI have some degree of relationship to the parent "big" science — cognitive psychology. That's why I decided to make 2 "parents" in the concept map, one is classical theories themselves and the other cognitive psychology which they all depend on. For every type of borrowing from it by HCI field — be it Jewel-in-the-mud approach, Basic research or Cognitive modelling — the limits and advantages are listed. There were actually much more models and frameworks for cognitive modelling that those depicted, for example, _Heuristic evaluation_, _Direct manipulation_, _Interface gulfs_ and others.
