## 1) What will be your UX evaluation tasks/interactions. Where in your prototype you want to focus your attention?

We have 3 tasks designated for prototype evaluation: a) login and join the playlist;
b) search for a specific song; c) vote for a song. 

We want to focus the attention on the actual applicability of our app to the situation of a potential user â€” will it be actually used or not is an important question. So one interesting variable would be arousal.

## 2) Enumerate possible expected results.

The expected enumerated results are:

1) efficiency;
2) learnability;
3) effectiveness;
4) number of errors per task;
5) the distribution (%) of emotions;
6) the amount of arousal brought by the app.

## 3) What methods you will use to collect expected results.

We plan to apply the Think-Aloud method to evaluate usability, it offers stable procedure and results for that. 

Also later in the process we think of using the 3E method to evaluate emotions and extract the overall feelings of the users. The emotion wheel seems also a feasible tool for extracting emotions in a manner more readily available for summarizing. Also SAM method may be useful, because it allows to measure the level of interest and excitement (arousal).

## 4) How many participants and whom 

We will evaluate 4-5 users, one at a time, according to the chosen procedures. We also consider additional evaluation of pairs of users to see how the collective interaction would work with our app.
