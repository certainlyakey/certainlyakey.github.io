##An animated graphic for CSS class

####Description

This graphic was made as a part of a CSS class presentation ([view in presentation](http://goo.gl/ZPHsqS#/81)). It was drawn and animated with the Hype app, which turned out to be the best choice around, I tried a lot of software.

There a lot of principles and nuances that are hard to explain in design and technology but (may be) easy to show. I liked the idea of visualizing the difficult spots in a fancy way for some time. Many examples show vividly that visualization works better for learning (for example, [this video](https://vimeo.com/93206523) or [this presentation](http://pepelsbey.net/pres/web-in-curves/)). One of the most difficult concepts to explain in CSS is float property and its many intricacies. One of them is the clearfix technique. To explain in what situations it is needed I decided to go with an animation hoping that it will do better than an interactive demo I had made earlier. The whole process took 6-7 hours. 

The most interesting parts were to create a proper rhythm in the animation by maintaining pauses between "action" sequences and to pick up a most natural animation for individual moves. Animations is much more music-like than graphic or information design - it's much easier to evaluate your creation, there's less usual "rose colored glasses" effect which prevents a creator from assessing his work immediately in an undistorted way. I got few evidence so far, but at least one student said that it was easier to understand the need for the clearfix technique with this animated graphic, so it may have been a success. I certainly plan to continue to use animated graphic as a mean of visualization.
