I have always been interested in the subject of design. After some time studying media design at the Faculty of journalism of Moscow State University I discovered that web design is a fast evolving industry, and its possibilities seem endless comparing to graphic and printed mass media design. As I graduated in 2006 with the graduation paper devoted to crossbrowser design nuances, I was already keen on continuing studying web design. My Ph.D. thesis which was finalized and defended in the end of 2009 was devoted to the multiple issues encompassing the design of newspapers online. After that I've been involved into teaching design at my faculty, at the same time doing research work. I had also started to pursue a career of freelance web designer and had some success in this role, having designed or coded more than 30 websites since 2005. 

I can list several reasons I apply to the Human Computer Interaction Master's Programme. 

First, the Programme will help me to perfect a more complete academic view of web design. It has always swayed between a kind of mutated "graphic design of XXI century", on one side, and an uncharted territory of technology requirements and limitations on another. These views both lacked one important aspect - human behaviour. With time my research focus has moved slowly to a more complex vision. It's clear now that web production integrates many aspects of many design areas. The interaction design, the user figure and experience are among the most important, and the most unexplored, at least in Russia. That's why I want to spend more time researching human computer interaction, hoping it will allow to somehow finalize my web design study and get a wholesome picture of it.

Second, the HCI area incorporates not only web, but also mobile, industrial and other sectors. I'd like to move further as a researcher from a limited view to more universal one, researching in a more generalized way applicable to any medium and finding its cases anywhere, not only on websites. So, generally, I'd like to move from a web design researcher role to a HCI/UX researcher role.

Third, the Programme, as I hope, would also allow me to get to know how to conduct the user studies, use practical instruments and create convincing documentation for interaction design projects - there're a lot of practical aspects of design production I find myself lacking the knowledge of. I'd like to use this as a base knowledge for research as well as in commercial design projects.

Fourth, I want to learn experiment-based research procedures and other methods accepted in HCI science culture, to make my research grounded, verifiable, less dependent on the products designers create, more dependent on actual users. 

Finally, because I like teaching, I hope that the Programme will eventually allow me to widen the spectre of subjects I'm able to teach. There's an altruistic side here: I'd like to teach people how to create something not just beautiful or plainly "working", but rather things that are useful and give a sense of pleasure and satisfaction. I'm really excited by the focus made in user centered design on a designer's empathy to a user, because it distances design from a cold, post-modern manipulative image it's given sometimes. Therefore, it would allow me to make my teacher role more universal and adapted to changing idea of a designer.

Here are my potential research topics (some represent the subjects of planned papers): 

- How affordances are applied by modern graphic interfaces
- Redundant coding in UI design
- Principles of naming for information scent in information architecture
- Usability decisions criteria: decreasing load vs delivering information 

Thus, I hope to use the HCI Programme to perfect myself as a researcher, designer and teacher.
